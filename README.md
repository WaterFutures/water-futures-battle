# The Battle of the Water Futures üö∞
## Designing the next generation of urban water systems

### Coming soon!

The highly anticipated 'Battle of the Water Networks' is back with a new challenge for the water distribution systems community.
This competition will be hosted at the **4th International Joint Conference on Water Distribution Systems Analysis and Computing and Control in the Water Industry** (WDSA/CCWI 2026), taking place in Paphos, Cyprus, from May 18-21, 2026.

> Participation in the competition is independent from participation, registration, and other commitments related to the conference. More information about the conference are available on the [conference website](https://www.wdsa-ccwi2026.ucy.ac.cy/).

This competition embodies the core mission of Water-Futures and the theme for WDSA/CCWI 2026: **"Designing the next generation of urban water (and wastewater) systems."**

The objective is to design and operate a water distribution system in the face of deep uncertainties.
For the first time, this challenge features a staged-design approach, unobservable and unknown uncertainties, and incorporates elements of policymaking and artificial intelligence.

## What to expect

* **The Challenge**: Design and operate a water distribution system over a long-term horizon under deep uncertainty, with interventions applied in stages.
* **Evaluation**: Your design will be assessed using a transparent and inspectable open-source evaluation framework.
* **Timeline**: Competition details and materials will be released soon!
