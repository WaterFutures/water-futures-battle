### Coming soon! 🔜

The highly anticipated 'Battle of the Water Networks' is back with a new challenge for the water community.
This competition will be hosted at the **4th International Joint Conference on Water Distribution Systems Analysis and Computing and Control in the Water Industry** (WDSA/CCWI 2026), taking place in Paphos, Cyprus, from May 18-21, 2026.

This competition embodies the core mission of Water-Futures and the theme for WDSA/CCWI 2026: **"Designing the next generation of urban water (and wastewater) systems."**

The objective is to **design and operate** a water distribution system over a long-term horizon **under deep uncertainty**, with interventions applied **in stages**.
For the first time, this challenge features a staged-design approach, unobservable and unknown uncertainties, and incorporates elements of policymaking and artificial intelligence.
The solutions will be assessed using a transparent and inspectable **open-source evaluation framework**.
