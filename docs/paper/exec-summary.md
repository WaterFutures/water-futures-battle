# Executive Summary {.unnumbered .unlisted}

This competition challenges participants to confront one of water distribution systems's most pressing problems: adaptive planning under deep uncertainty.
Participants will develop a 75-year national masterplan for a hypothetical Dutch water grid that must balance four competing objectives: financial sustainability, service reliability, environmental impact, and equitable access.
Unlike traditional planning exercises, this competition requires strategic decisions across three 25-year stages while navigating uncertain climate, energy, and economic scenarios.
Success demands developing an adaptive masterplan that blends policy decisions and infrastructure interventions, gets updated based on evidence accumulated across the implementation stages, and preserves flexibility to avoid locking into suboptimal pathways.
This document defines the competition framework; a subsequent report will present participant solutions and outcomes.
