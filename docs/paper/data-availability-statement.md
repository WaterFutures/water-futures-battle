# Data Availability Statement {.unnumbered}

All data versions are archived on Zenodo, with the latest version serving as the official standard [@battle_zenodo].
The files are also available in the [releases section of the GitHub repository](https://github.com/WaterFutures/water-futures-battle/releases).

The model uses data from trusted open sources under Creative Commons licenses (e.g., CBS and KNMI) and draws on publicly available reports (e.g., Vewin).
Where not explicitly cited, values are based on the authors' institutional knowledge or represent modeling assumptions.
