# How to participate
## Rules, deadlines, and ranking procedure

### Participation rules 🚷

The competition is organized as an __invited session__ at the WDSA/CCWI 2026 conference.
The process and timeline for the battle are __independent of the standard conference submission workflow__.

- Participants may submit a solution individually or as part of a team, but **each person can only be included in one team**. 
- If your team submits a solution, **at least one team member must register for the conference and present** your work at the event.
- Each team is **required to submit a short paper (4–6 pages) describing the methodology** used.

More information about the conference and the regular paper submission are available on the [conference website](https://www.wdsa-ccwi2026.ucy.ac.cy/).

> Authors are encouraged but not required to submit a regular contribution to the conference to participate in the competition.

## Ranking 📊

The exact ranking criteria for determining the winner are still being finalized and will be announced after the competition begins, along with further details about the problem.

For now, be aware that we will evaluate submissions using multiple metrics—such as cost, reliability, GHG emissions (as in previous competitions), and possibly new ones like fairness. The final ranking will reflect the social importance of these dimensions.
Despite the multi-objective nature of the challenge, each team must submit a single solution.
