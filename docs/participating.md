# How to participate

On this page you can find the [rules](#participation-rules-), [deadlines](#important-dates-️), [submission](#submitting-a-solution-) and [ranking](#ranking-) procedures.

## Participation rules 🚷

The competition is organized as an __invited session__ at the WDSA/CCWI 2026 conference.
Abstract submission, paper publication, and conference registration will follow the standard conference procedures and [platform](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/WDSACCWI2026/).
Solution submission will be handled through a different workflow [explained below](#submitting-a-solution-).

- Participants may submit a solution individually or as part of a team, but **each person can only be included in one team**. 
- **A team is considered formed when an extended abstract** (between 500 and 1000 words) **is submitted** through the conference platform.
The abstract should cover the aim, methodology, and originality of the solution the team intends to develop for the competition.
All individuals listed as authors in the abstract will be considered team members.
- Upon acceptance of the abstract, authors who have not yet registered through the standard conference submission will be able to register for the conference.
**At least one team member must register for the conference and present the work at the event.**
*Teams that do not have at least one registered member will not be considered eligible for the competition.*
- Teams whose abstracts have been accepted and who submit a solution following the competition guidelines **will have the option to submit a full paper (6-8 pages) describing their methodology** to be published in the conference proceedings.
Full papers will be reviewed for quality, and feedback will be sent to authors for any necessary revisions.
Full papers should be submitted in standard A4 paper format, following the template provided on the conference website.

More information about the conference and the abstract and paper submission are available on the [conference website](https://www.wdsa-ccwi2026.ucy.ac.cy/call-for-papers/).

> Authors are encouraged but not required to submit a regular contribution to the conference to participate in the competition.

## Submitting a solution 📩

We'll provide a solution template shortly.
We understand that addressing the problem is challenging enough, so the template will be designed to make submissions easy.
You'll be able to check the compliance of your solution through our open-source evaluator before submitting it.

## Ranking 📊

The exact ranking criteria for determining the winner are still being finalized and will be announced after the competition begins, along with further details about the problem.

For now, be aware that we will evaluate submissions using multiple metrics—such as cost, reliability, GHG emissions (as in previous competitions), and possibly new ones like fairness.
The final ranking will reflect the social importance of these dimensions.
Despite the multi-objective nature of the challenge, each team must submit a single solution.
