# Introduction

## Disclaimer
The networks and the problem are synthetic and not representative of the real situation in the case study. 
Where possible real data from trusted sources have been used but they may not agree 100%, everywhere else you find assumptions based on our and our institutions knowdlege.
We are extensively testing the model to make sure it is physically sounded and balanced (for example cost of electricity is well balanced with cost of infrastructure).


## Background and motivation

Why is this battle important and why is about decision-making under deep uncertainty applied to water distribution systems?

WDS systems grow organically with the city and therefore are affected by deep uncertainties

- Staged design can help delay expensive infrastructure interventions (Creaco et al., 2014)

- Robust staged design (accounting for uncertainty) works even better (Creaco et al., 2015)

- Flexible staged design (implementing action based on the uncertainty evolution) works even better (Basupi and Kapelan, 2015)

- Adaptive staged design has been proposed (Cunha et al., 2019) but a widespread and definition and how it varies from flexible it has not been defined

In adjacent fields, more examples are available
- Water Supply: Adaptive planning (Beh et al., 2017)
- Rhine Delta NL: Dynamic adaptive policy pathways (Haasnoot et al., 2013)
- Water Reservoir: “the value of learning” flexible planning (Skerker et al., 2023)

In general coherence in problem definition is missing.

None of the millions of approaches provided has been tested against each other. 

Even in the DMDU society there is no common testbed / benchmark to test methodologies, a few alternative problems

## Ambition

A highly detailed and uncertain model of a big transport network which can not be optimized with brute force.
We want to put the participants in a situation of deep uncertainty, so for this reason not only some parameters are uncertain (e.g., cost of running a production location for a year) but the evolution of the bound themselves is not disclosed. 
We want to force new methodologies to be applied and for the competitors to make some choices based on their belief for some policies parameters, 
rather then optimize every possible parameter.
Similarly we don't release the ranking process but only the metrics/KPIs because the participants will have to choose a compromise solution.
