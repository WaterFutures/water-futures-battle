# Introduction and work motivation

Why is this battle important and why is about decision-making under deep uncertainty applied to water distribution systems?

WDS systems grow organically with the city and therefore are affected by deep uncertainties

- Staged design can help delay expensive infrastructure interventions (Creaco et al., 2014)

- Robust staged design (accounting for uncertainty) works even better (Creaco et al., 2015)

- Flexible staged design (implementing action based on the uncertainty evolution) works even better (Basupi and Kapelan, 2015)

- Adaptive staged design has been proposed (Cunha et al., 2019) but a widespread and definition and how it varies from flexible it has not been defined

In adjacent fields, more examples are available
- Water Supply: Adaptive planning (Beh et al., 2017)
- Rhine Delta NL: Dynamic adaptive policy pathways (Haasnoot et al., 2013)
- Water Reservoir: “the value of learning” flexible planning (Skerker et al., 2023)

In general coherence in problem definition is missing.

None of the millions of approaches provided has been tested against each other. 

Even in the DMDU society there is no common testbed / benchmark to test methodologies, a few alternative problems
