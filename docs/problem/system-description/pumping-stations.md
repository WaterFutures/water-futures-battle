### Pumping stations

The pumps for the pumping stations must be selected exclusively from a pre-selected list of available pumps. These pumps are detailed in Tables P1 through P4 available in the Appendix A. Note that the provided pump curves only describe the working range of the pumps and must not be extrapolated beyond the values presented in the tables.
