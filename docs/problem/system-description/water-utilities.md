### Water Utilities

The system has multiple water utilities which is responsible to manage the system of one or more provinces.

Water utilities can and must take interventions within their own system (e.g., deciding the budget for non revenue water actions or replacing inter province pipes).
Water utilities can also take interventions in a collaborative approach, for example, the cost of a common pipe connecting two water utilities can be shared between the two utilities.

Water utilities number and responsabilities (assigned provinces) will not change during the competition.
