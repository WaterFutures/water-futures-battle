## System Decription

This chapter describes the physical components that constitute the water transport network in the BWF competition.
We present the key entities—municipalities, water sources, pumping stations, and pipes—detailing their characteristics, operational constraints, and how they evolve over time.
Each component's properties, costs, and decision variables are outlined to provide participants with a complete understanding of the system they will manage.
The physical feasibility of any network configuration is verified through hydraulic simulation in EPANET.
External factors affecting the system, such as climate conditions and the electricity grid, are addressed separately in @sec:ext-drivers.
