## System Description

This chapter describes the physical components that constitute the water transport network in the BWF competition.
The key entities are municipalities, water sources, pumping stations, and pipes and each of the following section will detail their characteristics, operational constraints, and how they evolve over time.
The physical feasibility of any network configuration is verified through hydraulic simulation in EPANET.
External factors affecting the system, such as climate conditions and the electricity grid, are addressed separately in @sec:ext-drivers.
