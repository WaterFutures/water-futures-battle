## System External Drivers {#sec:ext-drivers}

This chapter describes the external drivers that influence the national WDS and how they have been modelled in the BWF competition.
The key external systems modelled are the climate, the energy system, and the economic context.

These systems are beyond the direct control of the participants and introduce the main exogenous factors shaping the environment in which the transport network operates.
