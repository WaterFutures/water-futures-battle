# Evaluator

The Battle of the Water Futures (BWF) provides an evaluator to test the solutions before submission.

The BWF evaluator is a Python command-line application.
It takes a configuration file and a masterplan file as input, then simulates the system over the specified period.
The evaluator assesses the performance of the masterplan in response to the system dynamics and exogenous drivers defined in the configuration file.

Alternatively, users can import the BWF evaluator as a Python library and create their own executable scripts to customize its usage.

There are no restrictions on competitors forking the repository, implementing changes, or investigating the code.
